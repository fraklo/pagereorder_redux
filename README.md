Statamic PageReorder Redux Plugin
================================

## Description
This plugin was originally a simple modification of the add-on found here: https://github.com/jannisg/statamic-pagereorder. It's purpose is to enable the sorting of entries via the admin using drag and drop.

## To install
1. Download the zip file (or clone via git) and unzip it or clone the repo into `/_add-ons/`.
2. Check out your drag drop re-ordering via the admin. Snazzy.
